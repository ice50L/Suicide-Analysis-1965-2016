# Suicide-Analysis-1985-2016

# Introduction:
Suicide is a worldwide issue that plagues many countries due to widespread mental health issues. However, which demographics does suicide affect the most? Which country has the highest number of suicide numbers? Do men have a higher suicide rate compared to women? 
The data is taken from 1985-2016 from kaggle. Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016?datasetId=85351&language=Python. This dataset contains worldwide data and the suicide rates per country, as well as including the GDP per capita and the
country population. In this analysis, we aim to find out which countries are the most prone to succides, find out the reason why and ask other questions that may affect the suicide rates of each country.
